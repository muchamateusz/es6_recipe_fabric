# es6_recipe_fabric

This app was developed while finishing my study on "The Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
It is written completely using only JS without any frameworks or libraries (except fraction).
I've build it from scratch in less than 2 weeks (just a couple of hours per day of course).

I need to rebuild a css due to couple of bugs and because I want it to look differently.
There is couple of improvements to do left, which I left for another time to finish.
